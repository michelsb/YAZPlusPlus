To configure and compile yaz, simply do the following:

./configure
make

Yaz has been tested on MacOS X, FreeBSD, and Linux platforms.  You are offered
absolutely no guarantee for other systems.  The requirements for getting
yaz up and running are quite minimal, so with a little modification you
should be able to get it up and running on most any platform.  It requires
a working c++, STL, and Berkeley sockets.  Optionally, yaz may be compiled
to use libpcap for timestamps.

Please refer to the README for additional documentation, since yaz may 
require some tuning in order to achieve good results in your local environment.
